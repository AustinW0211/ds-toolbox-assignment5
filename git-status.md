# Definition: git status

The `git status` command is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

When you run `git status`, it provides information on:
- The branch you are currently on
- Changes that have been staged for the next commit
- Changes that have been made but not yet staged
- Untracked files (files not added to Git yet)
- If your current branch is up-to-date with the remote branch

In JupyterLab IDE, you can access similar information using the Source Control tab. It provides a visual representation of the status of your files, indicating which files have changes that are staged, unstaged, or untracked.
